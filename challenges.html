<ul class="missing_new">
    <li><b>Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Networks</b>: While this survey identifies challenges related to client mobility, it lacks specific methodologies for real-time adaptation to rapidly changing network conditions.  my research proposes a dynamic adaptive framework that continuously monitors client mobility and environmental conditions, enabling real-time adjustments in federated learning processes.</li>

    <li><b>Federated Learning for 6G-Enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems</b>: The paper discusses mobility in vehicular networks but does not provide detailed strategies for integrating federated learning with intelligent transportation systems in real time.  my dissertation focuses on developing specific algorithms that enhance federated learning in real-time applications for intelligent transportation systems, considering both mobility and data availability.</li>

    <li><b>Mobile Edge Computing and Federated Learning for Smart Cities</b>: This survey highlights issues of mobility but does not propose a comprehensive framework that combines mobile edge computing with federated learning to optimize resource allocation and communication.  my work aims to integrate mobile edge computing with federated learning to create a robust framework that addresses resource constraints and client mobility in smart city applications.</li>

    <li><b>Adaptive Federated Learning for Mobile Networks</b>: The proposed adaptive mechanisms may not fully account for the varying degrees of mobility and network conditions, leading to suboptimal performance in highly dynamic environments.  my research will develop an advanced adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts learning parameters based on real-time mobility patterns and network conditions, ensuring optimal performance across diverse scenarios.</li>

    <li><b>Federated Learning for Mobile Health: A Review</b>: While the paper discusses challenges related to mobility in mobile health applications, it lacks practical solutions for managing the effects of client mobility on data consistency and availability.  my dissertation focuses on implementing solutions to ensure data consistency and availability during client mobility, enhancing the reliability of federated learning in mobile health contexts.</li>

    <li><b>A Federated Learning Framework for Mobile Users in 6G Networks</b>: While this framework addresses mobility, it may not provide robust mechanisms for ensuring secure and efficient communication among mobile clients under varying network conditions.  my research will introduce security mechanisms and optimized communication protocols tailored for mobile clients in 6G networks, ensuring efficient and secure federated learning processes.</li>

    <li><b>Cooperative and Federated Learning for Mobile Networks</b>: The discussion on cooperative learning does not sufficiently address the challenges posed by client mobility, particularly in maintaining model accuracy and efficiency.  my dissertation aims to create a cooperative federated learning model that adapts to client mobility, ensuring model accuracy and efficiency despite fluctuating client availability.</li>

    <li><b>Federated Learning in 6G Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</b>: This article outlines challenges but does not delve deeply into specific solutions for managing client mobility in real-world applications.  my research will focus on developing practical solutions and frameworks that address client mobility challenges in real-world scenarios, enhancing the application of federated learning in 6G networks.</li>

    <li><b>Dynamic Client Selection for Federated Learning in Mobile Environments</b>: While the paper addresses dynamic client selection, it may not account for the impact of mobility on client availability and selection criteria, potentially leading to inefficient resource use.  my dissertation will propose a refined client selection process that incorporates mobility patterns, ensuring that the most relevant clients are selected for participation based on their availability and contribution potential.</li>

                    <ul>
           <li><b>Integration of Machine Learning for Decision Making</b>: Existing literature may not fully explore the application of advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning, meta-learning) to enhance real-time decision-making capabilities in federated learning.  my work could focus on employing such techniques to make adaptive decisions based on continuous data streams.</li>

<li><b>Multi-Dimensional Decision-Making Frameworks</b>: While some studies touch on real-time adaptability, they may not offer a multi-dimensional decision-making framework that considers various factors (e.g., latency, energy consumption, model accuracy) simultaneously.  my research could propose a more sophisticated approach that balances these competing priorities.</li>

<li><b>Response to Environmental Changes</b>: Existing research might not adequately address how federated learning systems can respond to environmental changes (like fluctuations in network quality or device availability) in real time.  my work could investigate mechanisms for rapid adaptation to these changes to maintain system performance.</li>

        <li><b>Comprehensive Sustainability Assessment Frameworks</b>: While some papers discuss sustainability metrics, there may be a lack of comprehensive frameworks that assess the long-term sustainability of federated learning practices, including social, economic, and environmental impacts.  my work could develop a more holistic sustainability assessment framework that encompasses these aspects.</li>

<li><b>Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Considerations</b>: While ethical implications are touched upon, there might be insufficient emphasis on how federated learning systems can be designed to comply with emerging regulations regarding sustainability and data privacy.  my research could address the integration of compliance mechanisms into sustainability metrics.</li>

<li><b>Empirical Validation of Sustainability Metrics</b>: Existing literature may lack empirical studies that validate the proposed sustainability metrics in real-world applications.  my proposal could emphasize the importance of conducting extensive simulations and real-world validations to demonstrate the effectiveness of  my sustainability metrics in practical scenarios.</li>
